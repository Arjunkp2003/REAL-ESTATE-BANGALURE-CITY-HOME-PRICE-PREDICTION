# REAL-ESTATE-BANGALURE-CITY-HOME-PRICE-PREDICTION

Model Description:

This regression model is designed to predict house prices based on key features of residential properties in Bengaluru. The features included are:

Location: The geographic area where the house is situated.
Size: The number of bedrooms in the house (e.g., 2 BHK, 3 BHK).
Bath: The number of bathrooms in the house.
Sqft: The total square footage of the house.
Price: The target variable representing the price of the house.
Objective: The primary goal of the model is to establish a relationship between the features and the house price, enabling accurate predictions for unseen properties. This will be achieved using a regression approach, as the target variable (price) is continuous.

Steps:

Preprocessing the dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (like location), and scaling numerical features if necessary.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Selecting an appropriate regression model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree regression, or other advanced models).
Training the model on the training set and evaluating its performance by using cross validation.and tacken best model
Expected Outcome: The model will provide an efficient and interpretable way to estimate property prices in Bengaluru based on the selected features.
